      <h4>As you may see in the picture above that this special pickle is called a chamoy pickle. 
        <br>They are one of my favoriates because you can wrap it with a fruit roll ups. 
        <br>Then you would cut it in half and put some mexican candy such as skweikles in there with tajin and eat it. 
        <br>This idea has exploded all over TikTok and is one you should try!</h4>
